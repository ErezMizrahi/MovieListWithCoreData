# MovieListWithCoreData

as part of a test i did for a job interview i was ask to create this app 

usage:
* CoreData
* URLSession - get data from an rest api (JSON) and parse it using jsonDecoder
* Display the data from the server in a list (Picture, Title, Data..) in order!
* if there is any data in the coredata database display it and if not read the data from the rest api, save it on the coredata database and display it
